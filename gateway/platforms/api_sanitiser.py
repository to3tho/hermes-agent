"""
Response sanitiser for the Remote Management API (`/api/*`).

The endpoints introduced in #23742 ship per-user identity content
verbatim:

* ``/api/memory`` returns ``user.content`` (the full USER.md
  profile).
* ``/api/sessions`` returns each row's ``system_prompt`` (the
  persona + skills index + the SAME USER.md content embedded
  inside, several KB per row).
* ``/api/sessions/{id}/messages`` repeats the ``role: "system"``
  content on every system message.

Bearer-token auth is the only access gate. A leaked or stolen
token exposes the user's identity profile in one request.

This module is the hard redaction layer applied as a
post-serialisation step on every response from the four affected
handlers. It is **not** opt-out and not opt-in: the Remote
Management surface is structural-only by policy.

If a legitimate identity-read flow ever needs to be added (e.g. a
desktop Persona-tab that wants to *render* USER.md content), it
should arrive via a separate auth class (loopback token,
SSH-tunnel-gated header, etc.) — not via re-loosening this filter.
